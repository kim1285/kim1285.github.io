            <h1>Full Rank Probability of Binary Matrices</h1>
        </header>

        <section>
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Calculate and visualize the probability that a random binary matrix of size 
𝑛×𝑚 is full rank, where 
𝑛 is fixed, and 𝑚 increases from 1 to 5, for a large number of random instances.</p>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>Generate random binary matrices for different values of  𝑛×𝑚, compute their rank, and determine the proportion of matrices that are full rank. Visualize the probabilities for each matrix size.</p>

	<h3>Implementation</h3>
		<ul>
                <li>Generate random 4 by 𝑚 binary matrix from 𝑚 = 1 to 5.</li>
                <li>Calculate the proportion of full-rank matrices for each matrix size.</li>
		<li>plot the result</li>
         	</ul>

         <h3>Result</h3>
		<p><img src="../pictures/project6_1.png" alt="project_1_1.png" class="responsive-image">
<img src="../pictures/project6_2.png" alt="project_1_1.png" class="responsive-image"> As 𝑚 gets closer to 𝑛(4), the probability of a matrix A being full column rank decreases and becomes 0 when 𝑚 gets bigger than 𝑛, because rank r cannot be bigger than 𝑚.
</p>

	<h3>Lext Steps</h3>
	<p>Investigate the effect of different matrix dimensions (e.g., non-square matrices) on the rank probability.</p>
