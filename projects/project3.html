            <h1>Statistical Analysis on US EV Market </h1>
        </header>

            <h3>problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Car is the second most expensive single purchase after a home for many consumers 
electric vehicle is the future direction
There may exist a potential niche market inside the most common sub-group of US EV consumers.</p>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>Identify the average age of US EV, most common Brand, EV Model and averages ranges.</p>

	<h3>Implementation</h3>
                <li>The original data was retrieved from the US Government website.</li>
                <li>The data was cleaned and EDA was conducted using pandas library.</li>
            </ul>

         <h3>Result</h3>

There were 46 number of EV makers, 170 different EV models, and total of 231,715 EVs in Washington only.
The most common car was Model Y, Most common Maker was Tesla, and the most common age of vehicle is 2 years old.
Further analysis is available on source code at Github link below.</p>

         <h3>limitations</h3>
		<p>During the datacleaing process Geological data is lost and only dataset of Washington was available.
While there will be more EVs in the future, integrating with existing ICE vehicles could provide more insight as of now.
Future studies would improve by addressing the issues above.</p>
