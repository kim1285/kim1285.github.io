            <h3>problem Statement</h3>
            <p>IR fire detection system is expensive compared to regular fire detection system.
High-volume-low-margin manufacturing sectors with higher risk of fire probably(...more research needed) doesn't adopt IR fire detection system. Example of those sectors include:

textile & garmet factories, 
food processing & grain storage, 
plastic rubber manufacturing.

Computation has become cheaper and there are many foundational models trained to finetune for rudimentary fire detection system to deplay fast and inexpensively.</p>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>Inexpensive non-ir camera live fire detection using smaller computer vision model finetuned to detect fire in large manufactoring facilities where smoke alarms are less effective due to the size.
Fine-tune a lightweight vision classification model using labeled data to predict images containing fire.</p>

	<h3>Implementation</h3>
                <li>preprocess images</li>
                <li>split training set</li>
                <li>train model</li>
                <li>predict</li>
            </ul>

Potential Cost Reduction: A fraction of the cost of IR-based fire detection systems.
Real-time Detection: Faster response compared to smoke alarms in large spaces.
Scalability: Easily deployable across multiple manufacturing plants with minimal changes.</p>

         <h3>limitations</h3>
		<p>Only the finetuning part has been completed and the system is not finished 
Environmental Sensitivity: Accuracy may be affected by lighting, reflections, and smoke dispersion.
False Positives: Requires ongoing model improvements to distinguish between actual fire and similar visual patterns.
Computational Constraints: Low-power edge devices may need optimizations for real-time processing.
Regulatory Compliance: May require certification or approval in fire safety regulations before large-scale adoption.</p>


	<h3>Next Steps</h3>
		<p>
next steps:
Finish the system
Conduct pilot tests in manufacturing plants.
Further optimize model efficiency and accuracy.
Enhance system integration with fire suppression and emergency response protocols.</p>
