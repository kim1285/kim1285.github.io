            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Manually tracking progress of long mathematics problem session was repetitive and more visual feedback would we encouraging</p>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>A script that breaks down a total number of problems into smaller sets. The user can track progress via a progress bar, and it provides control for skipping or advancing problems with keyboard input (Shift+Q to increase the count).</p>

	<h3>Implementation</h3>
		<ul>
                <li>The script takes the total number of problems and splits them into specified sessions.</li>
                <li>A progress bar (tqdm) tracks progress within each session.</li>
		<li>The user can increase the count in real-time by pressing Shift+Q.</li>
		<li>The script handles uneven division of problems and ensures the last session has any remaining problems.</li>
		<li>A prompt ends the process and congratulates the user upon completion.</li>
         	</ul>

         <h3>Result</h3>
		<p><img src="../pictures/project8_1.png" alt="project_1_1.png" class="responsive-image">The user can monitor their progress in solving practice problems, and the real-time input allows for quick adjustments to the problem-solving pace.
</p>

         <h3>limitations</h3>
		<p>Relies on the keyboard library, which may require administrator privileges. Does not track time spent on each problem, only progress. Requires a physical keyboard and may not work in environments where keyboard events are blocked.</p>

	<h3>Lext Steps</h3>
	<p>Add a timer to track time spent per session or problem.
Implement customizable inputs for various problem sets and sessions.
Create an interface for logging and analyzing performance over time.</p>
